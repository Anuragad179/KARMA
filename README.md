# KARMA
This is KARMA: it teaches that if you don't understand something, you shouldn't interfere with it.

My intension to Create this Shit was Personal Security of PC...
When you run KARMA.exe, it automatically sets itself to start at boot. You won’t see anything on your screen, but you’ll have 20 seconds to create a new folder with any name on the desktop to bypass the shutdown process. If no folder is created within those 20 seconds, the PC will shut down. Each time you log in, the process restarts for another 20 seconds. From a security perspective, the owner can use this as a unique method to safeguard their PC.

B U T . . .
I want to present this as an UNETHICAL SOFTWARE. If someone shares it with Malicious Intent and the recipient unknowingly runs it, the fault lies with the user for falling into the Trap due to their Lack of Awareness. That’s why I named this malware 'Karma.' It serves as a reminder to Broaden your Ethical and Unethical perspectives when considering Actions like this.
